# Continuous Wavelets
The `ContinuousWavelet` library implements (for now) only two *mother wavelets*.

```@docs
CauchyWavelet
MorletWavelet
```

All *mother wavelets* are derived from the abstract type

ContinuousWavelet.GenericContinuousWavelet
```

## Methods
```@docs
ContinuousWavelet.eval_analysis
ContinuousWavelet.eval_synthesis
ContinuousWavelet.eval_repkern
ContinuousWavelet.cutoff_time
ContinuousWavelet.cutoff_freq
```
